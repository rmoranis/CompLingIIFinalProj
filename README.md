## Computational Linguistics II Final Project: Chord Syntax in Theme and Variations by Mozart and Beethoven

In this project, I train and evaluate a text classifier to predict function labels from corresponding chord labels in a subset of works by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756–1791) and Ludwig van Beethoven (1770–1827) from the [TAVERN dataset](https://github.com/jcdevaney/TAVERN).

The full term paper, which explains the intended use of all files and scripts in this repository, is available upon request.
